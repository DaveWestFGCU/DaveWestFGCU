## Welcome!

I'm Dave, a senior in [Florida Gulf Coast University](https://www.fgcu.edu/)'s software engineering bachelor's program (class of Spring 2025).

I currently have 4 ongoing projects:
1. As a research assistant, I'm heading an NLP project [using GenAI to augment datasets](https://github.com/DaveWestFGCU/NLP_Augmentation_via_GenAI) for improving textual classifier models.
2. As a senior in the SWE program, I'm part of a team developing a resume screening tool utilizing GenAI in conjunction with an industry partner.
3. As a hobby I'm solving [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
   - I completed all [50/50 stars for this year's puzzles in C++](https://github.com/DaveWestFGCU/AdventOfCode_2024).
   - I will be going back to previous years to solve each year in a different language.
     - I'm learning web dev right now, so next up will be AoC 2023 in JavaScript.
4. To learn and reinforce web dev skills, I'm working on a [GitHub Pages](https://davewestfgcu.github.io/) to solve Advent of Code problems.

Right now I'm learning web development. Specifically, HTML/CSS/JS, Express+Node, and React.
